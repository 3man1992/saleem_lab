"""Given the length of data, it's not possible to use the optimal number of tapers. Many more should be used.
Increasing num tapers can increase accuracy of estimation but with significant cost in computational time.
1,199,000 precisely. Num_tapers = [2TW] - 1. With TW referring to the time bandwidth product.
Calculated using TW = len(data)Î”Fs/2
Increasing bandwidth also smooths the data at cost of computational effort.
BW = TW * fs / len(data). As per Chronux. Where TW equals 3.
However, GSP provides a calculate num tapers function which can do this for you.

How to smooth?
- Increase both num of tapers and NW together
